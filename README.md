## About

The general idea for Apiko is to have a backend REST API tool that will help you to setup a backend server as easily as possible.

Ideally, you would only have to code the URL handler functions themselves. Apiko should give you an interface to easily:

+ manage database collections
+ manage endpoint URLs and their parameters (Apiko server would validate the parameters according to your setup)
+ manage access rights
+ create documentation for your API for other developers

## About

Apiko is a REST API tool that helps you to setup a backend server as easily as possible. Apiko should gives you an interface to:

+ manage database collections
+ manage endpoint URLs and their parameters (Apiko server would validate the parameters according to your setup)
+ manage access rights
+ create documentation of your API for other developers

You only have to code where it's ultimately necessary. You can even build regular apps without coding a single line.
